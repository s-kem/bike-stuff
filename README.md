# bike-stuff

Fairly simple react/redux app for misc. bike calculators or whatnot.

Right now there's two pages, /gear-ratios and /watts-per-kg

/gear-ratios is a simple table layout where you can pick a crankset and cassette and then input a single speed gear set to compare.

The motivation behind that was figuring out which gear would give me a comparable ratio on my road bike when to get a feel for if I could handle a fixie all the time.

/watts-per-kg is a simple slider UI for calculating your watts per kg based on your weight and FTP. 

The motivation there was setting weight and FTP goals to hit my overall w/kg goal.

Based on a friend's react/redux starter kit, so there's still leftover code.
